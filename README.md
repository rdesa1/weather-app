# weather-app
This is a web application for the web development course at Umass, Dartmouth.

This React-based Weather App allows users to search for any city and view its current weather conditions. The app retrieves real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it using clean, responsive UI components styled with React Bootstrap and the Bootswatch "Morph" theme.
